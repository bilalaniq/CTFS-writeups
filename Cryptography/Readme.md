# Cryptography

This repository contains a focused collection of **Cryptography** challenges. Each challenge lives in its own folder and includes the challenge files (ciphertexts, keys, scripts, PDFs, etc.), analysis scripts and commands, write-ups/notes, and any tooling or helper scripts needed to reproduce the solve.

## Notes

- Each cryptography challenge is isolated in its own folder with relevant challenge files (ciphertexts, keys, scripts, PDFs, etc.) and analysis notes.
- Challenge details like known plaintexts, key material, parameter sizes, and any hints or implementation details are explicitly mentioned in the challenge notes.
- Difficulty levels for cryptography challenges:

  - **🟢 Easy** – single classical cipher or straightforward use of tools (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère, basic RSA low-hanging fruit)
  - **🔵 Medium** – requires chaining techniques or partial cryptanalysis (e.g., frequency analysis, padding oracle, broken MAC)
  - **🔴 Hard** – advanced crypto or implementation flaws (e.g., RSA CRT fault, custom crypto with subtle weaknesses, side-channel hints)
