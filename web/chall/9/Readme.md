**Challenge**: page asks for credentials and `otp` and give flag if otp is right


![first](./img/first.png)

it then asks for `otp`

![otp](./img/otp.png)

lets just use brupsuit to get the flag üòä


![burp](./img/burp.png)


Provide any random value as OTP and click on the Submit which will show a message as ‚ÄúInvalid OTP‚Äù.

now we will sendthe request to the `repeater` in burpsuit


![send_to](./img/send_to.png)


![repeater](./img/repeater.png)


one way we can do is that we can brute force it but here hint can come handy 

> Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.


You have **two POST requests** to `/dashboard`:

#### ‚úÖ Working one:

```
POST /dashboard HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 0
```

‚Üí **No body** (empty request)

#### ‚ùå Non-working one:

```
POST /dashboard HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 10
...
otp=121212
```

‚Üí **Has a body parameter** (`otp`)

### üß† Why the first (empty) POST works

Even though `POST` usually carries data, **an empty POST is still valid**.

The key is:

> Some web applications handle a missing POST body as a **special case**, especially if developers forgot to validate it properly.

So when you send:

```
Content-Length: 0
```

the backend might:

* Skip validation code (because there‚Äôs no form data)
* Treat it as a **default/admin request**
* Or **fall into a debug/error path** that leaks sensitive information like the flag

In other words, the backend could look like this:

```python
@app.route('/dashboard', methods=['POST'])
def dashboard():
    otp = request.form.get('otp')
    if not otp:
        # forgot to secure this
        return FLAG
    elif otp == '1234':
        return 'Access Granted'
    else:
        return 'Access Denied'
```

‚Üí When `otp` is missing (empty body), the first `if not otp` branch triggers and **reveals the flag**.

---

### üí£ Why the second (with `otp=121212`) fails

When you include:

```
otp=121212
```

the server receives a **non-empty form body**, so:

* It enters the next condition (`elif otp == '1234'`)
* But since `121212` is wrong, you get **‚ÄúAccess Denied‚Äù**
* You don‚Äôt hit the vulnerable branch
