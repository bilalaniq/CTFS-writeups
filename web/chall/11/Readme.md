lets open this in the burpsuit 

![burp](./img/burp.png)

here we can see the website file structure

![file_s](./img/file_s.png)

here the `secure.js` is the file we want

function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```

boom we got the credentials

This is a classic **client-side authentication** vulnerability (sometimes called *exposed secrets / insecure client-side logic*): the site performs the password check in JavaScript and actually ships the correct credentials (`admin:strongPassword098765`) to every visitor, so an attacker can simply read the JS (via View Source, Burp, or the browser console) and bypass authentication. To prevent this, **never perform authentication or store secrets in client-side code** â€” move all credential checking to the server, store only salted hashes of passwords (not plaintext), issue server-side session tokens on successful login, protect transport with HTTPS, and enforce protections such as rate limiting, account lockout, and proper input validation; treat client code as fully public (obfuscation is not a security control) and remove any hard-coded secrets or debug backdoors before deployment.
