### üîê What is `endbr64`?

The instruction:

```
f3 0f 1e fa   ‚Üí   endbr64
```

was introduced with Intel **Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET)**, which includes a feature called **Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT)**.

---

### üß† Purpose of `endbr64`

* **CET/IBT** aims to prevent exploits that use *indirect jumps* or *calls* to hijack control flow (like ROP).
* It requires that *indirect branches* (e.g., `jmp rax`, `call rdx`, etc.) **must** land on a valid target ‚Äî specifically, a function that starts with the `endbr64` instruction.
* If an indirect jump lands **anywhere else**, the CPU will raise an exception (if CET is enforced).

---

### ü™§ What happens if you call `0x401236` directly?

There are two possibilities:

#### ‚úÖ **If you're using a normal `call` instruction** (like `call 0x401236` in assembly):

* This is a **direct** control flow transfer.
* The CPU doesn‚Äôt enforce IBT on direct calls ‚Äî so this will *not* fail, even if `endbr64` is the first instruction.

**BUT‚Ä¶**

#### ‚ùå **If you're doing a buffer overflow**, you're overwriting the return address with `0x401236`.

* When `ret` executes, it **acts like an indirect jump**: it pops an address from the stack and jumps there.
* If CET is **enabled**, `ret` can **only** land on addresses that start with `endbr64`.

So in theory, landing at `0x401236` **should be fine**, because it **does** start with `endbr64`.

### ü§Ø But then why avoid `0x401236`?

1. **Compatibility**:

   * On older systems **without CET support**, `endbr64` is treated as a **NOP** (harmless).
   * But on some patched environments (e.g., hardened CTF servers), certain conditions (like mismatched instructions or compiler settings) might break execution.

2. **Side Effects**:

   * Starting execution *after* `endbr64` (i.e., at `0x40123b`, the `mov rbp, rsp`) **ensures consistent behavior** across **all environments**, regardless of CET.
   * It's a **safe and portable** way to jump into the function body, bypassing potential pitfalls.

---

### ‚úÖ Practical Rule of Thumb

* If **you‚Äôre not sure** whether CET is enforced or how the system will behave:

  * **Jump to just after `endbr64`**, like `0x40123a` or `0x40123b`.
  * This avoids execution starting at a potentially problematic instruction.
